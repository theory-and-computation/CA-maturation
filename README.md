## Overview

This project investigates the molecular mechanisms driving HIV-1 capsid maturation.  
Umbrella sampling is used to map the minimum free energy pathway (MFEP) describing the conformational change between immature and mature CA assemblies.  
End-state free-energy analysis quantifies the relative stability of molecular intermediates and the thermodynamic barriers along this pathway.
