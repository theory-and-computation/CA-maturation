For the block averaging test, we ran WHAM eight times on different 10ns blocks from the umbrella sampling set. To select a different block, edit get-colvars.py to read from a different directory and/or specify specific timepoints in that directory. All eight sets of output files are in this directory.

To rerun:

First, run get-colvars.py to create text files with the collective variables in each umbrella sampling window in the 1-timeseries/ folder.

Then, run gen-wham-cc-inp.py to create config files for the WHAM program. Some of these config files will go into the 2-windowparams/ folder. Edit this file to change the histogram bin size.

Finally, run the wham executable: ./wham
To save information about each bin, pipe to an output file: ./wham > wham-cc.out
