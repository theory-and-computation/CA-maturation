To rerun:

First, run get-colvars.py to create text files with the collective variables in each umbrella sampling window in the 1-timeseries/ folder.

Then, run gen-wham-cc-inp.py to create config files for the WHAM program. Edit this file to change the histogram bin size.

Finally, run the wham executable: ./wham
To save information about each bin, pipe to an output file: ./wham > wham-cc.out
